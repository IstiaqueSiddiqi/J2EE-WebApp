<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Aliah University started its glorious journey from the 2008-09 academic session with great potential and immense opportunities. It is hoped that this university, harmonizing tradition and modernity, will emerge as a unique institution of higher studies and research. As per Aliah University Act 2007, Section 3 (3), it has been conferred the status of a minority educational institution. Aliah University is an autonomous university under the Department of Minority Affairs and Madrasah Education, Government of West Bengal. It is hoped that along with the people of any race, creed, caste or class, this University will play a crucial and leading role in the advancement of higher education for socially and educationally backward classes belonging to the Minorities.</p>

<p><strong>The Early Years</strong></p>
<p>Calcutta Madrasah was established chiefly for the study of the Arabic and Persian languages and Muslim Law so that the sons of the Muslim gentry can perform the duties as officers for running the revenue administration and judiciary. The Naib Nizam was instructed to recruit the students of the Madrasah as vacancies occurred in the Fauzdari Courts, on production of certificates of efficiency. However, within a decade Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Astronomy, Islamic Theology, Oriental Studies, Natural Philosophy, Geological Studies, Law, Logic, Rhetoric, Grammar, and Oratory were added on the list of prescribed subjects for study. In 1821, the Annual Examination of the Madrasah was held in the presence of many respectable officials and gentlemen of Calcutta. This was the first public examination held in British India. A medical class, headed by Dr Breton, Professor of Medicine, was started at this Madrasah in 1826 for the first time in British India. Dr Breton was authorized to purchase a skeleton and collect medical books. An anatomical work published by John Taylor was arranged to be translated into Arabic. The medical class continued here till the establishment of Calcutta Medical College in 1836. However, the students of the Madrasah were allowed to study medicine at Calcutta Medical College. This speaks for the high standard of education at the Madrash in those days.</p>
<p>
This clearly shows that the curricula taught at this institution were a blend of theological studies, natural sciences and the humanities, as was done in the world-wide madrasah system of education which produced the galaxy of scholars who made original contributions to astronomy, mathematics, chemistry, physics, medicine, geology, art & architecture, and so on.
</p>
<p>
The authorities tried to introduce English as a subject for study in 1826. However, not many students were found willing to learn English as Persian was still the medium of administration in India. But in 1837 the colonial government replaced Persian with English as the official language. So the Anglo-Arabic Department was opened at the Madrash in 1839 for the teaching of English. However, at the recommendation of a Committee, again in 1854, this Anglo-Arabic Department was abolished and an English school, in the name of Anglo-Persian Department, was started under the direct control of the Principal of Calcutta Madrasah. The great reformist Nawab Abdul Latif (1828-1893), a product of Calcutta Madrasah, played an important role in the establishment of this Department so that Muslim children could receive the much-needed English education.

<p><strong>The Crisis of 1857 and After</strong></p>

<p>After the Great Rebellion or the so-called 'Sepoy Mutiny' of 1857, the British rulers began to have a suspicious attitude to the Muslims. Questions were raised regarding the maintenance of Calcutta Madrasah at Government cost. There were proposals to abolish the Madrash, at least the Arabic Department, retaining only the Anglo-Persian Department. However, in 1860, the Government of India, rejecting the idea of abolition, rather recommended improvement in its management. So the Madrasah continued to exist.</p>
<p>In 1869, a Committee consisting of C.H. Campbell, Commissioner of the Presidency Division, I. Suitcliff, Principal of Presidency College, and Nawab Abdul Latif, then a Deputy Magistrate, was formed to inquire into the affairs of the Madrasah and suggest improvement. Some reforms were introduced at the Calcutta Madrasah according to the suggestions of this committee. Further reforms were introduced at the recommendations of the Education Commission headed by W.W. Hunter in 1884. Nawab Abdul Latif and Justice Syed Amir Ali played a very important role in these reforms. In 1896, Elliot Hostel was founded, with funds raised out of donations from the public, for the accommodation of the Madrasah students who so far had used the ground floor of the Madrasah as their hostel. In 1902 the Muslim Institute was established as a part and parcel of Calcutta Madrasah. The Principal of the Madrasah was ex-officio President and Treasurer of the Muslim Institute. Several committees and commissions were appointed in 1915, 1923, 1931, 1938-40, and 1946 for the improvement in the syllabi, curricula, and all round development of Madrasah education in Bengal, particulary of Calcutta Madrash.</p>

<p><strong>The Post-Independence Period</strong></p>
<p>The Partition of India in 1947 dealt a serious blow to this historic institution. According to the decision of the 'Separation Council', all the movable properties including the Library with its thousands of rare books and manuscripts of Calcutta Madrasah were transferred to Dacca Madrasah. Calcutta Madrasah almost ceased to exist. But responding to the demands of the leading Muslims of West Bengal, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the first education minister of independent India, took the initiative to reopen Calcutta Madrasah on 4 April 1949. In the following years many great scholars and educationists who also took part in India's freedom movement served this institution as principals and teachers. The 205th Foundation Day was celebrated in 1984 with great enthusiasm. In 1985, His Excellency Shri Uma Shankar Dikshit, the then Governor of West Bengal, in his inaugural speech at a belated Bicentenary function of Calcutta Madrasah, proposed that Calcutta Madrasah should be treated as an educational institution of national importance and be upgraded to a University.</p>
